## Chapter 4: Links

- ***Links*** are created using the `<a>` element.
- The `<a>` element uses the `href` attribute to ***indicate the page we are linking to***.
- If we are linking to a page within our own site, it is best to use ***relative links*** rather than qualified ***URLs***.
- We can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- We can use the `id` attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

#### Keywords:

`<a>` Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
  
`Absolute URL` When you link to a different website, the value of the `href` attribute will be the full web address for the site.

`Relative URL` When you are linking to other pages within the same site.

`Directories` Folders on a website. 

`mailto: ` To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address.

`target` If I want a link to open in a new window.


## Chapter 15: Layout

#### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

1. **Building Blocks**:
   - `Block-level` elements start on a new line
   - `Inline elements` flow in between surrounding text
   
2. **Containing Elements**: If one block-level element sits *inside* another block-level element then the **outer box** is known as the **containing or parent element**.  


### Position property in CSS

#### Kyewords:

`position:static`: default

`position:relative`: moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

`position:absolute`: the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on the page. 

`position:fixed`:  a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property
to have a value of fixed
