## Chapter 2: Text

- ***Structural markup***: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs. 
- ***Semantic markup***: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence.

#### Headings 
```
`<h1>`Heading 1</h1>
`<h2>`Heading 2</h2>
`<h3>`Heading 3</h3>
`<h4>`Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```
![headings](https://www.schudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/html-headings.png)

#### Paragraphs
```
`<p>`A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
 that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
 line.`</p>`
 ```
- Tags are often referred to as ***elements***. 
- Tags usually come in ***pairs***. 
- The ***opening tag*** denotes the start of a piece of content; the ***closing tag*** denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry ***attributes***, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a ***name and a value***. 
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, and what they do.

 ## Chapter 8: Extra Markup 

- ***DOCTYPES*** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add ***comments*** to your code between the <!-- and --> markers. 
- The ***id and class*** attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The ```<div>``` and ```<span>``` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- ```<iframes>``` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The ```<meta>``` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- ***Escape characters*** are used to include special characters in your pages such as `<`, `>`, and `©`.
