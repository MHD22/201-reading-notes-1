##### Note: Keywords are emphasised.

## Chapter 1: Structure

- HTML pages are ***text*** documents. 
- HTML uses ***tags*** (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as ***elements***. 
- Tags usually come in ***pairs***. 
- The ***opening tag*** denotes the start of a piece of content; the ***closing tag*** denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry ***attributes***, which tell us more about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a ***name and a value***. 
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, and what they do.

 ## Chapter 8: Extra Markup 

- ***DOCTYPES*** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add ***comments*** to your code between the <!-- and --> markers. 
- The ***id and class*** attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The ```<div>``` and ```<span>``` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- ```<iframes>``` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The ```<meta>``` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- ***Escape characters*** are used to include special characters in your pages such as `<`, `>`, and `©`.

#### The two images below shows some markups:

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its ***structure***.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand ***HTML5*** elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

## Chapter 18: Process & Design

- It's important to understand who your ***target audience*** is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- ***Site maps*** allow you to plan the structure of a site. 
- ***Wireframes*** allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- ***Design*** is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using ***size, color, and style***. 
- You can use ***grouping and similarity*** to help simplify the information you present.

## Chapter 1: The ABC of programming

- A ***script*** is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a *subset of all the instructions*.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so yhe instructions must let *the computer solve the task prggrammatically*.
- To approach *writing a script*, break down the goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
